# Rules

A die can move a number of squares up to to half its size. It can move in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. A d6 can move only one or two squares.

When you take a turn, choose one of your dice and move it. You can end your move in the same square as your opponent's die, initiating an attack against that die.

When you attack, roll the attacking die. Your opponent will roll the defending die. Whichever die rolls lower is removed from the board. In case of a tie, the defending die wins. When a d20 is defending, roll a d6 instead of it.

You have a +3 bonus on the first attack roll of your turn.

If the first attack on your turn succeeds, you can immediately take another turn. You must use the same die for this turn.

If a die successfully attacks another die of the same size or larger, is it promoted to one size larger than the die it attacked. A d12 is promoted to a d20. A d20 can't be promoted any further.

The game ends when one of the players has no dice left. The player with at least one die remaining wins.
