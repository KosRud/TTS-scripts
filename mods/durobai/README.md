# Rules

1. A die can move a number of squares up to to half its size. It can move in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. A d6 can move only one or two squares.
2. A die can not pass through another die when moving.
3. When you take a turn, choose one of your dice and move it. You can end your move in the same square as your opponent's die, initiating an attack against that die.
4. When you attack, roll the attacking die. Your opponent will roll the defending die. Whichever die rolls lower is removed from the board. In case of a tie, the defending die wins. When a d20 is defending, roll a d6 instead of it.
5. You have a +3 bonus on the first attack roll of your turn.
6. If the first attack on your turn succeeds, you can move the attacking die again.
7. If a die successfully attacks another die of the same size or larger, is it promoted to one size larger than the die it attacked. A d12 is promoted to a d20. A d20 can't be promoted any further.
8. Both players start with 30 hit points. Victory is achieved by reducing your opponent to 0 hit points.
9. As a first attack on your turn, you can damage the opponent's hit points directly instead of attacking a die. To do this, your die must end its move in the row of squares nearest to your opponent or already be there at the start of your turn. Roll the attacking die, the number rolled is subtracted for the opponent's hit points. Then your turn ends.



## Experimental variant

Each player has 30 hit points.

If your die is already standing in an empty square on the opponent's edge of the board, or you end its move in such a square, you can roll that die to reduce opponent's hit points. This ends your turn.

A player who's hit points reach 0 is defeated.
